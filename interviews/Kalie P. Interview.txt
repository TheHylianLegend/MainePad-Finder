Yes. Okay, let's get started. I'm here with Kaylee parody. So what's been your experience finding housing near campus?

Unknown 0:11
I found it to be very expensive and unaffordable.

Unknown 0:16
All right, so what's the price of rent that you would prefer if

Unknown 0:20
I was paying just by myself, preferably anything under $1,000

Unknown 0:25
yeah, I agree. Has this been your biggest barrier finding housing around campus, or have you run into any other problems?

Unknown 0:33
Um, definitely, just the pricing for sure, without feeling like I have to have a million roommates. Yeah, true. How far are you willing to commute to school

Unknown 0:44
if you were to be paying for housing around school,

Unknown 0:48
if I were paying for housing and then commuting from what I'm paying for? Yeah, if I'm paying for rent, I'd rather not pay much for gas too and mileage, so probably like 20 minutes, yeah, fair.

Unknown 1:03
What are some things that you look for in a potential roommate,

Unknown 1:06
cleanliness and respect? Probably, yeah,

Unknown 1:12
what would you want to know about a property before renting it?

Unknown 1:16
I'd want to know if anyone died there. Yeah. I

Unknown 1:26
i The appliances that comes with, yeah. More importantly, what

Unknown 1:32
would you want to know about the property's landlord before moving somewhere?

Unknown 1:36
If he's what's the word? If he has good response time if I need something fixed. And, yeah, he's reliable.

Unknown 1:43
Yeah, definitely. Um, what would you want to know about your roommates before renting your property with them?

Unknown 1:51
Um, if they are good with their money, if I know that, they'll pay, like, their half of everything on time and then again, like, just them, like being clean and considerate?

Unknown 1:59
Yep, I know this is a little bit redundant, but have you experienced any difficulties in renting a property in the past? If so, what so this can go? Can be like price experiences with roommates, landlords, like all the things that I've mentioned before. Have you had any troubles with those in the

Unknown 2:20
past? Um, no, not particularly, but I know a lot of people who have had to move back in with their parents because pricing is so high. Yeah, true.

Unknown 2:30
How frustrating has commuting been to college so far this year?

Unknown 2:35
Oh, very frustrating. Takes a lot of time out of my

Unknown 2:37
day. Yeah, understandable.

Unknown 2:41
Um, if you had to rent out a new property right now, what would be one thing that would motivate your decision the most? Would it be affordability, size, proximity to campus?

Unknown 2:53
Probably affordability. Because if it's affordable, I wouldn't mind driving farther.

Unknown 2:57
Yeah, definitely.

Unknown 3:00
Um, are there any aspects of a rental property that would be a deal breaker for you?

Unknown 3:06
Um, probably, hmm, I'm trying to think, if it didn't have parking, but didn't have parking, yeah, I think, and then, yeah, it'd be, like, way too much with no parking, like having to pay for parking as well. That probably, or if it didn't have, like, a dishwasher. probably, or washer or dryer.

Unknown 3:25
Yeah, so I told you a little bit about the main pad application that we're creating Um, is there any other features you would like to see on the main pad finder that would help you

Unknown 3:35
out. Um,

Unknown 3:39
no, no, says, good. All right. Thank.
