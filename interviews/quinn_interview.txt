Ashley Pike  
All right. Hi, thank you for interviewing with me today. First I'm going to have you introduce yourself.

Quinn Richter  
All right. My name is Quinn Richter. I'm currently a junior in college, and at the moment, I'm doing online college.

Ashley Pike  
Alright, so first off, how far would you be willing to commute to school

Quinn Richter  
for me personally, I would say around 30 minutes. I've had a couple semesters where I did commute to school and it was a 20 minute commute, depending on traffic, and that was

about as far as I'd like to drive just because, if your classes are spaced throughout the day, it can be inconvenient to go back and forth between home if it's like longer than 30 minutes.

Ashley Pike  
So

hypothetically, if you were to want to rent a property as a student, what would you want to know about the property before renting it.

Quinn Richter  
Big things would be,

of course, location, relative to the school,

the price, obviously, if, like, what? How many? How easy would it be to have roommates, if there'd only be like one bedroom, or if there'd be, like, a kitchen that I could share with people, or if we could split up, like the living spaces, just because as a college student, can be difficult. It's depending on where you live, because of, like, pricing to be able to afford an apartment by yourself. And then also, I guess it's physical location is not only how close it is to the school, but also what's around the apartment. Are there places to get food easily, like a gas station or a grocery store? Or would it be like in a suburban area where you would have to use a car to then get to places? So I'd prefer like an area kind of more in the city, where there's things around, where you can, like, walk and it's easier instead of having to drive everywhere.

Ashley Pike  
And as you said, if you were to have, like, roommates, um, what would you want to know about them before renting renting a property with them?

Quinn Richter  
Big things would be how financially stable they are and how responsible they are with money, um, if they are, you know, incapable of actually, like, if they blow their money on, like, frivolous things that they don't really need, and then aren't prioritizing, you know, like, rent money. Cleanliness as well. Are they? Is it there has to be, like, some kind of base level, like, they aren't just leaving food and like clothes and dishes and trash everywhere.

And like, Do they smoke? Like, do they have good, decent hygiene? Like, as long as they aren't actively, like, disrupting if my personal space and making my living situation like worse than I would normally have it, then it's probably fine,

Ashley Pike  
all right, if you had to rent out a property right now, what would be the One thing that would motivate your decision the most? I

Quinn Richter  
uh, probably proximity to, um, other people, because currently I'm not really it's pretty far from, like, friends, relationship, etc, so I'd probably want to move somewhere that's, you know, has closer access to those things, instead of Having to, like, travel a lot farther.

Ashley Pike  
Are there any aspects of a rental property that would be a deal breaker for you?

Quinn Richter  
Um, if there is, I think, like, black mold, or, like, any kind of, like, yeah, black mold, like pests, like cockroaches, like, if there's like, some kind of infestation or something, that would kind of be a sign that maybe the landlord is not the most diligent and care about the property, which is probably a sign that if something breaks, like a utility, like, no hot water, etc, that they might not be very Urgent with that, and so I know, and I'm not really trying to live, like without hot water for like a week or so. And it's just like, it can be, you know, it's not a good sign. It's yeah, and it's just also kind of gross to be in a living space that just is not I. Feel very clean inherently, if there's like just crap around,

Ashley Pike  
all right? Well, I think that's all the questions I have for now and perfect for interviewing me.

Quinn Richter  
Yeah, of course. Thank you for having me. You.
